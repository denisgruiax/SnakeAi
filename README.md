## About the game

**Game Description:** We want to create a classic snake game where we're going to implement a
    Machine Learning algorithm.

**Main Characters:** The game is going to has only one character, the snake.

**Story:** The game is going to be played in two modes, classic game or AI game. 
In both cases, the main character will be placed in a garden, where in random position at a time apples will be thrown away.
For every apple that the snake eats, it will grown. If the snake bites his body, or is going to hit the wall, the game will restart.

**Gameplay**
```
Goal: Growing the snake and achieve highest score that the respective player can do.

Player Skills: The game is going to be simple, the players will can move the snake in four
    directions(up, down, left, right) and by getting a higher score the snake will get some power-up because the game will be harder.

Game mechanincs: In time of the gaming, there will be 5 buttons, 4 buttons for move and one button for activating power-ups. 

Power-ups: Slow-down or increase the speed, invicibility, special apples that increase the score.

Levels and challanges: With each level passed, the snake will unlock a power. The main challange and the only one is that the snake will growing 
    and the game will be more harder to play.

Losing: If the snake goes in the wall or bites his body, the game is going to finish.
